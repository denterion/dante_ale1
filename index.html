        Hogfish are the chameleons of the Atlantic Ocean, seamlessly changing their skin color depending on their environment.
        As if those morphing skills weren't impressive enough, these reef dwellers can also "see" with their skin with the help
        of special light-sensing cells,
        even after they die, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.

        Lorian Schweikert, an assistant professor in the Department of Biology and Marine Biology at the University of North Carolina
        Wilmington as well as an avid angler, witnessed this color-shifting phenomenon 
        firsthand during a fishing expedition in Florida, when she watched a hogfish 
        (Lachnolaimus maximus) she caught change its skin color to match the patterned white deck of the boat.

        "They appear to be watching their own color change," 
        Schweikert, who is also the lead author of the study, said in a statement.

    <p width="300px" class="Text_Free">Hogfish are typically found in coral reefs and are master magicians; as protogynous hermaphrodites, 
        they can switch their sex from female at birth to male as adults, according to the Georgia Aquarium.
        Now Schweikert and her co-authors think they've discovered how this color-shifting magic works 
        by identifying specialized light-sensing cells located beneath a layer of color-changing cells in the hogfish's skin. 
        This system enables them to watch their skin change color and adjust it to match their surroundings, 
        according to the study.
